# FIT for production of electricity
# kWhFIT_lower_limit - lower_limit subsidized price for production 1kWh, EUR per 1kWh
# kWhFIT_upper_limit - upper_limit subsidized price for production 1kWh, EUR per 1kWh
# real kWhFIT will be random value in range(from=lower_limit, to=upper_limit, step=0.001)
# delay_lower_limit -  lower_limit duration of subsidy in MONTHS since start of the project
# delay_upper_limit -  upper_limit duration of subsidy in MONTHS since start of the project
# subsidy_delay - months between the start of electricity production and start of subsidy due to permitting
